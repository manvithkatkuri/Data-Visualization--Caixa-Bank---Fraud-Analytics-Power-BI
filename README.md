# Data-Visualization--Caixa-Bank---Fraud-Analytics-Power-BI
Fraud Detection &amp; Analytics with Python, SQL, Machine Learning, and Power BI End-to-end project on analyzing financial transaction datasets to detect fraud patterns, develop supervised ML models, and design interactive Power BI dashboards for real-time fraud monitoring.
# CaixaBank Fraud Detection & Analytics 

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing publicly available bank transaction datasets to **detect fraud**, **identify high-risk customer profiles**, and **recommend fraud prevention strategies**. 

# Fraud Detection & Analytics 
This project is my deep dive into **bank transaction fraud detection**.  
I wanted to build something end-to-end — from cleaning messy datasets to building ML models, and finally creating dashboards that a business team could actually use.

## 🔍 What this project does
- Cleans and prepares transaction data with Python  
- Uses SQL to spot fraud "hotspots" (online merchants, certain regions, high-value cards)  
- Builds **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree** models to predict fraud risk  
- Visualizes everything in **Power BI dashboards** with KPIs, filters, and drilldowns  

## ⚙️ Tools I used
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib for data cleaning & feature engineering  
- **SQL**: Fraud segmentation, rate calculations, trend analysis  
- **Machine Learning:**
  - Logistic Regression & Decision Trees
  - Features: timing, high-value flags, card frequency
  - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC
  - Fraud Risk Score integrated into dashboards 
- **Power BI**: Dashboards with fraud by card type, merchant, geography, customer profile  


## 📈 Dashboards
I designed an interactive Power BI report that shows:  
- Fraud Rate % and Risk Level Distribution  
- Fraud by **age/gender, card brand, merchant category, and geography**  
- High-risk customer profiles with fraud scores  
- Custom templates with collapsible filters for better user experience  
## 🚀 Applications & Future Scope
This project isn’t just about crunching numbers. The dashboards and models can be applied in:  
- **Finance:** Monitor fraud in near real-time  
- **Cybersecurity:** Spot anomaly and intrusion patterns  
- **Retail:** Track suspicious purchase trends  
- **Business Strategy:** Summarize KPIs and guide decisions
